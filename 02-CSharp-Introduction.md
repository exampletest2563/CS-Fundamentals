// TODO: Class & Methods.
In C#, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining the data (fields) and behavior (methods) that the objects will have. 

### Class
```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    // Fields
    private int myField;

    // Constructor
    public MyClass(int initialValue)
    {
        myField = initialValue;
    }

    // Property
    public int MyProperty { get; set; }

    // Method
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Methods
Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from the class.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    // Method with no return value
    public void MyVoidMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This method returns void.");
    }

    // Method with a return value
    public int MyIntMethod()
    {
        return 42;
    }

    // Method with parameters
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

- **Void Method:** Performs an action but does not return a value.
- **Return Method:** Performs an action and returns a value.

## 📢 C# Output

// TODO: We use code written by someone else.
**C# Output**

In C#, leveraging code authored by others involves integrating external libraries, frameworks, and APIs. This is facilitated through namespaces and references.

### Incorporating External Code

1. **Namespaces:**
   - Organize classes and methods for easy accessibility.
   - Allow usage without fully qualifying names.

2. **Adding References:**
   - Include external libraries or assemblies to utilize their functionalities.
   - Add references in Visual Studio or manage NuGet packages.

### Example Usage with External Library (Newtonsoft.Json)

1. **Install via NuGet:**
   ```bash
   Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
   ```

2. **Using in Code:**
   ```csharp
   using Newtonsoft.Json;

   public class Program
   {
       public static void Main()
       {
           var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new { Name = "John", Age = 30 });
           Console.WriteLine(json);
       }
   }
   ```

// TODO: Using System;
In C#, the `using System` directive is crucial as it imports the `System` namespace, which is fundamental for various functionalities in C# programming. This includes essential classes and methods for tasks like console input/output, working with data types, managing files, and more.

Example Usage:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

By including `using System`, developers gain direct access to commonly used classes and methods within the `System` namespace, streamlining the coding process and enhancing code readability.

The `Console` class in C# provides the `Console.WriteLine` and `Console.Write` methods for outputting text to the console window.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

The `Console.Write` method outputs text without appending a newline character.

```csharp
Console.Write("Hello World!");
```

## 💭 C# Comments

Comments do not represent actual instructions. They can be used to explain the source code, and to make it more readable.

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); // This is a single-line comment

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It is capable of encapsulating comprehensive explanations.
*/

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

Comments can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

```csharp
// Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

We will use comments to highlight important segments of the source code.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); // 👈 Prints "Hello World"
```

Yes, that's correct! When programming, developers often use code written by other developers to save time and effort. This code can come in various forms:

1. **Libraries**: These are collections of pre-written functions and routines that developers can use to perform common tasks. For example, in C#, developers might use libraries like .NET Framework or third-party libraries like Newtonsoft.Json for JSON parsing.

2. **Frameworks**: Frameworks provide a structure for building applications and often come with pre-built components and libraries. For example, in web development, developers might use frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js to build user interfaces.

3. **Modules and Packages**: In languages like Python, developers use modules and packages to extend the functionality of their programs. These modules and packages are created by other developers and can be installed and imported into projects as needed.

4. **Open Source Projects**: Developers also contribute to and use open-source projects, which are software projects that are freely available and developed collaboratively by a community of developers. These projects cover a wide range of applications and can be a valuable resource for developers.

By leveraging code written by other developers, programmers can build upon existing solutions, focus on solving specific problems, and accelerate the development process. This practice is fundamental to the collaborative nature of software development and helps drive innovation in the field.

## 🧨 Compilation Errors

// TODO: Console.WriteLine("test);
For this chapter, here are two examples demonstrating how a missing closing double quote in the `Console.WriteLine` statement results in a compilation error:

1. **Example 1:**
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("test);
   ```
   - Error: Missing double quote at the end of the string literal.
   - Compiler will report: "CS1010: Newline in constant"

2. **Example 2:**
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("test);
   Console.WriteLine("Hello");
   ```
   - Error: Same as above.
   - Compiler will report: "CS1010: Newline in constant"

// TODO: Console.WriteLine("test")

A compilation error, also known as a compile-time error or syntax error, occurs when the code written by a programmer cannot be translated into machine code by the compiler. This typically happens due to mistakes in the code that violate the rules and syntax of the programming language being used.

Compilation errors prevent the compiler from creating an executable program because it cannot understand the code as written. Instead, the compiler generates error messages that indicate where the problem occurred and what needs to be fixed. These error messages often include information such as the line number, file name, and a description of the issue.

Common causes of compilation errors include:

1. **Syntax Errors**: These occur when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language. For example, missing semicolons, parentheses, or curly braces can lead to syntax errors.

2. **Type Errors**: These occur when there is a mismatch between the data types used in the code. For example, trying to add a string and a number together can result in a type error.

3. **Undefined Symbols**: These occur when the compiler encounters a variable, function, or class that has not been defined or declared before it is used.

4. **Missing Libraries**: These occur when the compiler cannot find the necessary libraries or dependencies required to compile the code.

Compilation errors must be fixed before the code can be successfully compiled and executed. Developers typically review the error messages provided by the compiler, locate and correct the errors in their code, and then attempt to compile the program again until no errors remain.

1. **Code Completion:** As you type code, IntelliSense suggests available classes, methods, properties, and variables based on the context. For example, if you type `Console.Wri`, IntelliSense will suggest `Write`, `WriteLine`, etc., from the `Console` class.

2. **Parameter Information:** IntelliSense displays information about method parameters as you type, helping you understand what arguments are expected. For instance, typing `Console.WriteLine(` will show information about the `string` parameter that the `WriteLine` method expects.

3. **Quick Info:** Hovering over a code element such as a method, class, or variable shows a tooltip with quick information about it. This includes its declaration, type, and summary comments if available.

These features streamline the coding process, making it faster and more accurate.

// TODO: No New Lines
**No New Lines**

In programming, "No New Lines" refers to situations where code or input lacks proper line breaks, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. In this chapter, we delve into the realm of "No New Lines," a concept critical for ensuring smooth code execution and data handling. Here, we explore various scenarios where the absence or mismanagement of line breaks can lead to unexpected outcomes or errors in programming.

### Understanding the Issues:

1. **Syntax Compliance:** Programming languages often mandate specific line-ending characters, like semicolons in C# or colons in Python, to denote the end of statements. Neglecting these can result in syntax errors during compilation or interpretation.

2. **File Integrity:** Text-based files, including source code and data files, rely on correct line breaks for proper interpretation. When these breaks are missing or incorrectly formatted, it can disrupt file parsing and compromise data integrity.

3. **Input Challenges:** Processing input from external sources, such as files or user inputs, demands careful handling of line breaks. Failure to account for variations in line break formats can lead to data misinterpretation and processing errors.

### Solutions and Best Practices:

1. **Enforcing Consistency:** By ensuring adherence to language-specific line break conventions in code files and maintaining proper formatting in data files, developers can prevent syntax errors and parsing issues.

2. **Utilizing Line-Ending Visibility:** Employing text editors that display line endings (e.g., CRLF for Windows or LF for Unix) aids in identifying and rectifying line break discrepancies, promoting code clarity and correctness.

3. **Implementing Robust Validation:** Incorporating robust input validation mechanisms in code enables the graceful handling of input data with irregular line breaks, bolstering application resilience and reliability.

// TODO: Comments
**Comments**

In C#, comments are annotations within the code that provide additional information to developers. They are ignored by the compiler and serve to document the code's purpose, logic, or usage.

### Purpose of Comments:

1. **Clarification:** Comments elucidate complex or obscure sections of code, aiding comprehension for developers who may encounter the code in the future.

2. **Documentation:** Comments document the intent, functionality, and usage of classes, methods, and variables, facilitating code maintenance and collaboration among team members.

3. **Debugging:** Comments can temporarily disable or isolate sections of code during debugging, allowing developers to troubleshoot issues without altering the code structure.

### Types of Comments:

1. **Single-line Comments:** Prefaced by double slashes (`//`), single-line comments span a single line and are typically used for brief explanations or annotations.

   ```csharp
   // This is a single-line comment
   int x = 10; // Assigning value to variable x
   ```

2. **Multi-line Comments:** Enclosed within `/*` and `*/`, multi-line comments can span multiple lines and are suitable for longer explanations or comments.

   ```csharp
   /*
   This is a multi-line comment
   It spans multiple lines
   */
   ```

### Best Practices:

1. **Be Concise:** Keep comments brief and to the point, focusing on essential information without unnecessary verbosity.

2. **Maintain Accuracy:** Ensure comments remain up-to-date with corresponding code, avoiding discrepancies that can lead to confusion.

3. **Use Descriptive Names:** Employ descriptive variable, method, and class names to minimize the need for explanatory comments.

### Example:

```csharp
// Calculate and display the sum of two numbers
int num1 = 5;
int num2 = 7;
int sum = num1 + num2; // Calculate sum
Console.WriteLine("The sum is: " + sum);
```

In this example, comments clarify the purpose of variables and the logic behind calculating the sum, enhancing code readability and understanding.

**Rearranging the Code**

"Rearranging the code" involves reorganizing code elements to enhance readability, maintainability, or performance without altering its functionality. Here's a breakdown:

### Purpose:

1. **Improving Readability:** Restructuring code logically makes it easier for developers to understand and work with.

2. **Enhancing Maintainability:** Well-organized code simplifies maintenance tasks, reducing time and effort required for modifications.

3. **Optimizing Performance:** Code rearrangement can lead to performance gains by optimizing algorithms or reducing redundancy.

### Techniques:

1. **Code Refactoring:** Restructure code without changing its external behavior, such as extracting methods or eliminating duplication.

2. **Modularization:** Break large, monolithic code into smaller, reusable modules for better organization and maintainability.

3. **Organizing Imports:** Group import statements consistently to improve code clarity and organization.

### Considerations:

1. **Maintain Consistency:** Adopt a consistent coding style and organization scheme across projects and team members for better collaboration.

2. **Use Version Control:** Employ version control systems like Git to track changes and revert modifications during code rearrangement.

3. **Test after Rearrangement:** Perform thorough testing to ensure that code changes introduced during rearrangement do not cause unintended consequences or regressions.

### Example:

Before Rearrangement:
```csharp
int CalculateSum(int[] numbers)
{
    int sum = 0;
    foreach (int num in numbers)
    {
        sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

After Rearrangement:
```csharp
int CalculateSum(int[] numbers)
{
    // Calculate sum using LINQ
    return numbers.Sum();
}
```

In this example, the code for calculating the sum of an array is refactored to use LINQ's `Sum()` method, resulting in cleaner and more concise code.
