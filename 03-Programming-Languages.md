## ðŸ”¤ Programming Languages

Programming languages represent sets of rules and symbols used to write instructions (`code`) that computers can understand and execute.

Programming languages act as the bridge (`interface`) between human thought and machine execution. For developers, these languages provide a way to express algorithms and manage data. For computers, they translate human-readable code into machine-readable instructions, enabling the execution of tasks and operations.

Key Concepts:

- `Syntax`: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered to be correctly structured programs in a language.
- `Semantics`: The meaning of the symbols, expressions, and statements in a programming language.
- `Compiler`: A program that translates code from a high-level programming language to a machine language.
- `Interpreter`: A program that directly executes instructions written in a programming language without requiring them to have been compiled into machine language.

Programming languages differ in several key areas: abstraction (low-level/high-level), syntax, semantics, paradigms (programming style), performance (speed/efficiency), type systems, availability of pre-built tools and resources, platform compatibility, community and support.

Low-level languages are closer to machine code and provide little abstraction from the hardware. Examples: Machine Language, Assembly Language. High-level languages are more abstract and easier for humans to read and write. They are designed to be more intuitive and closer to human languages. Examples: C#, Java, Python, JavaScript.

Syntax is the set of rules and structure that govern the way code is written. For instance, in Python, indentation is used to define code blocks, whereas in C++, braces are used.

Semantics deals with the rules, meaning and structure behind the constructs and commands used in programming.

Paradigms refer to the supported programming styles. Examples: Java supports object-oriented programming, while Haskell supports functional programming.

Performance refers to the speed and efficiency of code execution. For instance, C is faster than Python.

Type systems are concerned with the management of data types within programming languages. Certain programming languages are classified as statically typed, whereas others are categorized as dynamically typed. C# and Java are examples of statically typed languages, whereas JavaScript is an illustration of a dynamically typed language.

When writing code, it is common to utilize code that has been previously written by others. The availability of libraries and frameworks, which are pre-built tools and resources, varies across programming languages. Libraries and frameworks can be thought of as packages that encompass various functionalities, and they can be conveniently imported into your codebase.

Community and support play a crucial role in the world of programming. The size and activity of both user and developer communities can greatly impact the success and growth of a programming language. This can vary depending on the country in which the language is being used. For instance, there may be extensive support for popular languages like JavaScript, while more niche languages like Rust may have a smaller but dedicated community.

Programming languages also differ in terms of their platform compatibility, which refers to their ability to run on various operating systems and environments. Some languages are specifically designed for certain operating systems, such as Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.

Furthermore, programming languages vary in their intended purpose. While some languages are considered general-purpose, like C# and Java, others are domain-specific. For example, HTML and CSS are used for creating and styling web applications, while SQL is used for managing and querying relational databases.

> HTML, CSS and SQL might not meet the criteria to be classified as programming languages; instead, they could be categorized as a markup language (HTML), a stylesheet language (SQL) or query language (SQL).
