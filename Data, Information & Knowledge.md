# Data, Information & Knowledge

## 📈 Understanding Data

### 🤔 What is Data?

Data is the raw, unprocessed facts and figures that we collect about the world. Think of data as the building blocks that can be combined to create something meaningful. Data comes in many forms, such as numbers, text, images, and even sounds.

Data refers to the unprocessed and raw facts and figures that we accumulate about the world. Visualize data as the fundamental building blocks that can be combined to form something meaningful. Data manifests in various forms, including numbers, text, images, and even sounds.

Examples of Data:
- Numbers: 23, 42, 7.89
- Text: "Hello, world!", "C# programming"
- Images: A picture of a sunset 🌅
- Sounds: The sound of a bird chirping 🐦

### 🗂️ Types of Data

Data can be categorized into different types:
1. Structured Data: It is organized in a fixed format, such as databases or spreadsheets (e.g., Excel files).
2. Unstructured Data: It lacks a predefined structure, like emails, social media posts, or videos.
3. Semi-structured Data: It is not as rigid as structured data but still possesses some organization, like XML or JSON files.

Information is data that has been processed and organized in a way that makes it meaningful and useful. It answers questions like "who," "what," "where," "when," and "how."

Examples of Transforming Data into Information:
- Raw Data: 25, 30, 35, 40
- Information: "The temperatures for the week are 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, and 40°C."

In this example, individual temperature readings (data) are combined to give a summary of the week's weather (information).

Data becomes information by first collecting raw data, then processing it by sorting, filtering, and organizing, and finally presenting it in meaningful ways such as charts, reports, or summaries.

Knowledge is the understanding and insight gained from processing information. It involves recognizing patterns, making connections, and applying information to make decisions or solve problems.

Knowledge refers to the comprehension and perception acquired through the processing of information. It encompasses the ability to identify patterns, establish connections, and utilize information in order to make informed decisions or resolve complex problems.

Examples of Knowledge:
- Information: "The temperatures this week are 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, and 40°C."
- Knowledge: "It is getting progressively hotter throughout the week, so it might be wise to stay hydrated and wear light clothing."

The Data-Information-Knowledge hierarchy represents the transformation from raw data to valuable knowledge:
1. **Data**: Raw facts (e.g., individual temperature readings).
2. **Information**: Organized data (e.g., weekly temperature summary).
3. **Knowledge**: Insights derived from information (e.g., understanding the weather trend and its implications).

Let's see a simple example of how you can process data in C# to turn it into information and knowledge.
