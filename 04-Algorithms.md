## 🧪 Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It consists of a finite set of instructions that, when followed, accomplish a particular task.

The term algorithm may be described as a procedure or formula.

Algorithms are essentially a series of steps or rules that guide the process of solving a problem or completing a task. In the context of everyday activities like brushing teeth, algorithms can be applied to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, the algorithm for brushing teeth may involve steps such as wetting the toothbrush, applying toothpaste, brushing teeth, and rinsing the mouth.

Step 1. 💦 Wet the Toothbrush
Step 2. 🪥 Apply Toothpaste
Step 3. 🫧 Brush Teeth
Step 4. 😁 Rinse Mouth

The algorithm, written in C#:

```csharp
WetToothbrush();

ApplyToothpaste();

BrushTeeth();

RinseMouth();
```

Does this algorithm effectively address the problem at hand? Indeed, it does. However, it is crucial to consider how we should handle various specific situations or edge cases that may arise.

The initial inquiry revolves around the duration required for brushing teeth.

```csharp
WetToothbrush();

ApplyToothpaste();

while (TeethNotClean())
{
	BrushTeeth();
}

RinseMouth();
```

The subsequent inquiries would revolve around the availability of toothbrushes and toothpaste. Are there any alternative methods to accomplish the task?

```csharp
if (HaveToothbrush() && HaveToothpaste())
{
	WetToothbrush();
	
	ApplyToothpaste();
	
	while (TeethNotClean())
	{
		BrushTeeth();
	}
	
	RinseMouth();
}
else if (HaveAlternativeMethod())
{
	UseAlternativeMethod();
}
else
{
	throw new UnableToBrushTeethError();
}
```

If we want to be better developers, we need to learn how to ask questions that might give us more information about:

- Solving the problem;
- Considering all extreme cases;
- Ensuring the expected result.

Happy coding and happy brushing! 😊🦷
