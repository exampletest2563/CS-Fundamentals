### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Website Tile</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="tile">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Website Thumbnail" class="tile-img">
        <div class="tile-content">
            <h3 class="tile-title">Useful Website</h3>
            <p class="tile-description">A brief description of the useful website. It helps users understand what this website offers.</p>
            <a href="#" class="tile-link">Visit Website</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    margin: 0;
}

.tile {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 300px;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.tile:hover {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
    box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.tile-img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 150px;
    object-fit: cover;
}

.tile-content {
    padding: 15px;
}

.tile-title {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 1.2em;
    color: #333;
}

.tile-description {
    margin: 10px 0;
    color: #666;
}

.tile-link {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 10px 15px;
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: #fff;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.tile-link:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

### Explanation
- **HTML**:
  - The `tile` div acts as a container for the entire tile.
  - Inside it, an `img` element represents the website thumbnail.
  - The `tile-content` div contains the title, description, and link.

- **CSS**:
  - Basic styles are applied to the body for centering the tile and giving it a neutral background.
  - The `tile` class styles the main container, adding background color, border-radius, shadow, and transitions for hover effects.
  - The `tile-img` class ensures the image covers the container width and height properly.
  - The `tile-content` class adds padding around the text content.
  - The `tile-title` and `tile-description` classes style the text elements.
  - The `tile-link` class styles the link button, adding padding, background color, border-radius, and hover effects.
