# üéì Computer Programming Introduction

## üåç Data, Information & Knowledge

Data refers to a collection of raw facts, often presented in numerical or symbolic form. Data could refer to anything that could be measured, counted or qualified.

In C#, data is often represented using variables. Variables act as containers for storing different types of data, such as numbers and symbols.

Information is data that has meaning, context, and purpose. Information is what we derive when data is collected, analyzed and presented in a meaningful way, order or context.

In C#, this involves processing and organizing data through algorithms and logic.

Knowledge represents the wisdom we gain when we understand and connect different pieces of information. Knowledge is the deeper understanding or the application of information in a meaningful way that comes from putting together various bits of data and information and making sense of them.

## üíª Computer Programming

Computer programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to follow. Think of it like giving a recipe to a chef. The recipe tells the chef step-by-step how to make a dish. Similarly, a computer program tells the computer step-by-step how to perform a task.

Here's a simpler breakdown:

1. **Instructions**: Programmers write instructions in a language that computers can understand, like Python, Java, or C++.
2. **Tasks**: These instructions tell the computer how to do specific tasks, like adding numbers, displaying text, or playing a video.
3. **Code**: The set of instructions is called "code." Just like a recipe has ingredients and steps, code has commands and rules.
4. **Execution**: When the computer follows these instructions, it "executes" the code, making things happen on your screen.

In summary, computer programming is creating a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do.

## üî§ Programming Languages

Programming languages act as the bridge (interface) between human thought and machine execution. They represent sets of rules and symbols used to write instructions (code) that computers can understand and execute.

Programming paradigms define the style of programming. C# supports imperative, declarative and object-oriented paradigms.

Programming languages are interfaces for both developers and computers. They allow developers to write instructions that computers can execute. For developers, these languages provide a way to express algorithms and manage data. For computers, they translate human-readable code into machine-readable instructions, enabling the execution of tasks and operations. Thus, programming languages bridge the gap between human logic and computer functionality.

Programming languages differ in several key areas: syntax, which dictates the rules and structure for writing code; semantics, which define the meaning of constructs and commands; and paradigms, which support various programming styles such as object-oriented or functional. They vary in performance, with some languages executing faster than others. Type systems also differ, with languages being either statically or dynamically typed. The availability of libraries and frameworks, community and support, and platform compatibility further distinguish them, influencing the choice of language based on project requirements and developer preferences.

- Syntax: Rules and structure for writing code (e.g., Python uses indentation, C++ uses braces).
- Semantics: Meaning of the constructs and commands (e.g., how loops and conditionals function).
- Paradigms: Programming styles supported (e.g., object-oriented in Java, functional in Haskell).
- Performance: Speed and efficiency of code execution (e.g., C is faster than Python).
- Type Systems: Handling of data types (e.g., statically typed in Java, dynamically typed in JavaScript).
- Libraries and Frameworks: Availability of pre-built tools and resources (e.g., NumPy for Python, STL for C++).
- Community and Support: Size and activity of user and developer communities (e.g., extensive for JavaScript, niche for Rust).
- Platform Compatibility: Ability to run on different operating systems and environments (e.g., Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android).

## üß™ Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem. Think of it as a clear and precise recipe or a manual that guides you through a process from start to finish.

Here are some real-life examples:

1. **Making a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich**:
   - Step 1: Take two slices of bread.
   - Step 2: Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread.
   - Step 3: Spread jelly on the other slice of bread.
   - Step 4: Press the two slices of bread together, with the peanut butter and jelly sides facing each other.
   - Step 5: Cut the sandwich in half, if desired.

2. **Brushing Your Teeth**:
   - Step 1: Get your toothbrush and toothpaste.
   - Step 2: Apply a small amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush.
   - Step 3: Wet the toothbrush under the tap.
   - Step 4: Brush your teeth for two minutes, making sure to cover all areas.
   - Step 5: Rinse your mouth and the toothbrush.

3. **Tying Shoelaces**:
   - Step 1: Cross the laces.
   - Step 2: Make a loop with one lace.
   - Step 3: Wrap the other lace around the loop.
   - Step 4: Pull the wrapped lace through the hole.
   - Step 5: Tighten the loops to secure the knot.

In each example, an algorithm provides a clear sequence of steps to achieve a specific outcome, whether it's making a sandwich, brushing teeth, or tying shoelaces.

Sure! Let's use the example of baking cookies, incorporating conditions and loops.

### Baking Cookies

#### Basic Algorithm:
1. Gather ingredients (flour, sugar, butter, eggs, chocolate chips, etc.).
2. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
3. Mix dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt) in one bowl.
4. In another bowl, cream together butter and sugar.
5. Add eggs and vanilla to the butter-sugar mixture.
6. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.
7. Stir in the chocolate chips.
8. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes.
10. Remove cookies from the oven and let them cool.

#### Adding Conditions:
Conditions are like "if" statements that make decisions based on certain criteria.

- **Step 3 (Mixing dry ingredients)**:
  - If using self-rising flour, skip adding baking soda and salt.

- **Step 5 (Adding eggs and vanilla)**:
  - If you want a stronger vanilla flavor, add an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract.

- **Step 9 (Baking cookies)**:
  - If the cookies are not golden brown after 12 minutes, bake for an additional 2-3 minutes.

#### Adding Loops:
Loops repeat a set of steps until a condition is met.

- **Loop for dropping dough onto the baking sheet**:
  - While there is dough left in the bowl:
    1. Scoop a spoonful of dough.
    2. Drop the dough onto the baking sheet.
  
  This loop continues until all the dough is used.

- **Loop for baking multiple batches**:
  - While there is more dough left after the first batch:
    1. Preheat the oven (if it has cooled).
    2. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet.
    3. Bake for 10-12 minutes.
    4. Remove cookies from the oven and let them cool.

  This loop ensures that each batch is baked properly until all the dough is used.

### Summary

- **Conditions** help decide what to do based on specific criteria (e.g., type of flour, desired flavor strength, cookie doneness).
- **Loops** help repeat actions until a task is complete (e.g., placing dough on the sheet, baking multiple batches).

By using conditions and loops, we make the algorithm flexible and efficient, handling different scenarios and repeating necessary steps until all the cookies are baked.

## üîß Integrated Development Environments

We use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for programming because they provide advanced features that significantly boost productivity and code quality. Unlike basic text editors, IDEs offer syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, and integrated version control. These capabilities enable us to identify errors early on, streamline coding tasks, and enhance overall efficiency, making IDEs the preferred option for software development.

**Compilers:**  
A compiler translates high-level source code into machine code or bytecode before execution. It performs lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. Compiled code is stored in executable files and does not need recompilation unless source code changes.

**Interpreters:**  
An interpreter executes source code line by line without prior compilation. It reads, interprets, and executes code immediately, allowing for rapid development and testing. Interpreted code may run slower than compiled code due to on-the-fly translation during runtime.

For developers, compilers offer advantages in terms of performance and efficiency. Compiled languages typically run faster because the source code is translated into machine code beforehand, reducing the overhead during runtime. This makes compiled languages like C, C++, and Java preferable for applications requiring speed and optimization, such as games or system software.

On the other hand, interpreters offer flexibility and ease of use. They allow for quick development and testing as changes in the source code can be immediately executed without the need for recompilation. Interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are favored for rapid prototyping, scripting, and web development due to their agility and dynamic nature.

Ultimately, the choice between compilers and interpreters depends on the specific requirements of the project, including performance considerations, development speed, and the target environment. Many developers leverage both compilers and interpreters in their toolkit to harness the benefits of each approach as needed.

Compile time is the stage during software development where source code is converted into machine code or bytecode by a compiler. This process checks for syntax errors and translates human-readable code into a format that the computer can understand and execute.

Runtime, also known as execution time, happens when the compiled code is actually run by the computer's processor. It encompasses the entire duration of the program's execution, from start to finish, including any input, processing, and output operations that occur during this time. During runtime, the program interacts with the computer's hardware and peripherals to perform the tasks defined by the code.
