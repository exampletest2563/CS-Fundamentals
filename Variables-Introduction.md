## ðŸ“¦ Variables Introduction

Variables are containers for storing and managing data. They allow us to name and manipulate values.

```csharp
//          ðŸ‘‡ Value
int number = 5;
//   ðŸ‘† Variable name

Console.WriteLine(number); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints "5"
```

```csharp
//                   ðŸ‘‡ Value
string firstName = "John";
//        ðŸ‘† Variable name

Console.WriteLine(firstName); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints "John"
```

Variables declared with the `int` keyword store integers.

Variables declared with the `string` keyword store text values or "strings".

Imagine building a shopping cart. Variables would hold information like item names, quantities, and prices.

### Variables Introduction ðŸ“Š

#### What are Variables?

In programming, a variable is like a container or storage location that holds data. Think of it as a labeled box where you can put different things, like numbers, words, or other pieces of information.

#### Why are Variables Important?

Variables are essential because they allow us to work with and manipulate data in our programs. Instead of hard-coding specific values directly into our code, we can use variables to store and update information dynamically.

#### How to Use Variables?

To use a variable, you need to declare it first. This means you're telling the computer to set aside some memory to store the data. Here's how you declare a variable in most programming languages:

```plaintext
dataType variableName;
```

- **dataType**: This specifies the type of data the variable can hold, such as numbers (integers or decimals), characters, or boolean values.
- **variableName**: This is the name you give to your variable. It's like the label on your container.

#### Example:

Let's say we want to store a person's age in a variable called "age". We can declare it like this:

```plaintext
int age;
```

This tells the computer to create a variable named "age" that can store whole numbers (integers).

#### Assigning Values to Variables:

Once you've declared a variable, you can assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=). This is like putting something into your container.

```plaintext
variableName = value;
```

#### Example:

```plaintext
age = 30;
```

Now, the variable "age" holds the value 30.

#### Using Variables in Operations:

You can perform operations with variables just like you do with actual values. For example, you can add, subtract, multiply, or divide them.

```plaintext
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
int sum = x + y;
```

Now, the variable "sum" holds the value 8.

#### Conclusion:

Variables are powerful tools in programming that allow us to work with and manipulate data dynamically. By understanding how to declare, assign values to, and use variables in our programs, we can create more flexible and efficient code that can adapt to different situations and requirements.
