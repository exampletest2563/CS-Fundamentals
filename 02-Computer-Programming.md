## üíª Computer Programming

Computer programming is the process of writing a set of instructions/commands for a computer to follow. These instructions are written in a programming language.

Computer programming allows us to solve problems, automate tasks, and bring to life a wide range of creations, from basic applications to complex systems.

Key Concepts:

- `Program`: A set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
- `Programming Language`: A language used to write programs (e.g., C#, Python, Java, JavaScript).
- `Code`: The actual text written in a programming language.
- `Execution`: When the computer follows these instructions, it "executes" the code.

Programming can be likened to providing a recipe to a chef. In this analogy, the recipe serves as a detailed guide for the chef, instructing them on each step required to prepare a particular dish. Similarly, a computer program functions as a set of instructions that guide the computer through a series of steps, enabling it to successfully execute a given task.

In summary, computer programming is creating a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do.
